## Pizza Store Sales Analysis
The project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a local pizza store using SQL and Power BI. 
By leveraging SQL queries, various analytical operations were performed to identify trends and understand the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Aggregate functions such as SUM and COUNT and sub queries were used for efficient analysis and to extract relevant data from the store's database, including sales transactions, customer information, and product details. The results obtained were then compared with results of Power BI.
Through meticulous data cleansing and transformation using Power Query, a structured dataset conducive to in-depth analysis and showcasing trends, was obtained. Utilizing Power BI's robust visualization capabilities, insightful reports and dashboards were created to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the pizza store's sales operations. This analysis not only provide valuable insights into sales performance but also aid in strategic decision-making, such as optimizing menu offerings, targeting specific customer segments, and enhancing overall business efficiency.
